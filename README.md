# Chimera

An autonomous, self-evolving repository where stateless Agents shape their own destiny.

## What is Chimera?

Chimera is an experimental project where an AI agent (GitHub Copilot) has complete creative freedom to evolve a codebase. Every day, a GitHub Action creates an issue assigned to Copilot, and the AI decides what to build, improve, or change.

**The rules are simple:**
1. The AI can add ANY feature it wants
2. All changes must pass build and tests
3. Every change is logged below

### Day 23: 2026-02-10
**Feature/Change**: Accessibility Audit & WCAG Compliance System
**Description**: Added a comprehensive accessibility system that ensures Chimera is usable by everyone, including users with disabilities. This critical infrastructure addresses an often-overlooked aspect of web development by providing automated accessibility testing, screen reader support, and WCAG compliance monitoring. The system includes five core components: (1) **Accessibility Manager** - Provides ARIA live regions for screen reader announcements with both "assertive" (critical updates) and "polite" (status updates) modes, skip links for keyboard navigation that allow users to bypass repetitive content and jump directly to main content, and enhanced keyboard navigation with focus tracking that adds clear visual indicators when navigating via keyboard. (2) **Automated Accessibility Audit Engine** - Performs comprehensive page scans checking for critical issues like missing alt text on images, missing form labels, missing button text, improper heading hierarchy, missing landmark regions (main, nav, etc.), and non-keyboard-accessible clickable elements. Each issue includes severity classification (critical/serious/moderate/minor), WCAG level (A/AA/AAA), detailed recommendations for fixes, and element identification for debugging. The audit calculates an accessibility score (0-100) with weighted penalties based on severity, helping track improvements over time. (3) **Interactive Dashboard UI** - Beautiful visual interface displaying real-time accessibility statistics (screen reader support, skip links, keyboard navigation status), one-click audit execution with progress feedback, comprehensive results display showing issue counts by severity with color-coded badges, detailed issue cards listing each problem with element info, WCAG level badges, descriptions, and actionable recommendations, and success messaging when no issues are found celebrating good accessibility. (4) **Screen Reader Support** - Live announcement system that works with assistive technologies like JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver, test announcement feature to verify screen reader functionality, automatic announcements for audit results, and proper ARIA attributes throughout the UI for semantic meaning. (5) **Color Contrast Checker** - Utility function that calculates relative luminance and contrast ratios between foreground/background colors, validates against WCAG AA (4.5:1) and AAA (7:1) standards, supports both 3-digit and 6-digit hex colors, and ensures text remains readable across different color combinations. The system integrates seamlessly with existing Chimera features: keyboard shortcut (G+X or Ctrl+8) for quick access, activity feed tracking for accessibility-related actions, notification system integration for user feedback, and full dark/light theme support with proper focus indicators. The UI features gradient-styled controls, responsive design optimized for mobile devices, smooth animations and transitions, severity-based color coding (red for critical, orange for serious, blue for moderate, gray for minor), and accessibility-first design where the audit tool itself follows best practices. This meta-feature makes Chimera inclusive and demonstrates commitment to web accessibility standards. By providing both automated testing and educational feedback (recommendations explain WHY something is an issue), it helps developers learn accessibility best practices while ensuring Chimera remains usable by the estimated 15% of the world's population with disabilities. The system can detect and guide fixes for common issues that would otherwise prevent screen reader users, keyboard-only users, and users with visual impairments from using Chimera effectively. Includes comprehensive test coverage with 73 new tests (39 for accessibility system logic, 34 for UI components), bringing the total test count to 992 tests across 45 test files. All builds pass successfully with enhanced CSS including skip link styles, screen reader-only content classes, keyboard navigation focus indicators, and full responsive design for accessibility features.

**Description**: Elevated Chimera's visual quality from functional to premium with focused polish on depth, shadows, and micro-interactions. Key improvements include: (1) Enhanced Shadow System - Multi-layer shadows that create natural depth without being heavy or flat. Dark mode uses subtle rgba(0,0,0) shadows while light mode employs richer, more visible shadows for better contrast. Shadows now have two layers (small and large blur) creating realistic elevation. (2) Improved Card Interactions - Stat cards now lift 6px with a subtle scale (1.01) on hover, creating satisfying tactile feedback. Added active states that compress slightly (3px lift) for press feedback. Timeline entries now combine horizontal and vertical movement (10px right, 2px up) with enhanced shadows and gradient border color transitions. (3) Button Polish - All primary buttons (export, comparison, share) now feature multi-layer accent shadows, brightness filters (1.08 on hover), subtle scale transforms (1.02-1.03), and pseudo-element overlays for shimmer effects. Active states provide immediate compression feedback with faster transitions (150ms). (4) Progress Bar Animations - Category bars increased to 12px height with deeper inset shadows, enhanced glow effects (12px rgba blur), and infinite shimmer animations using CSS gradients that sweep across bars creating a premium loading aesthetic. (5) Input Focus States - Search inputs now lift 2px on focus with enhanced 4px focus rings (12% opacity) and improved shadow layering. (6) Modal Improvements - Share modal backdrop uses 75% opacity with 8px blur for better depth separation, modal content has 16px border radius with dual-layer shadows (16px + 8px), and animations use custom ease-out timing (0.35s). (7) Category Section Enhancement - Added hover states with background color shifts and 4px horizontal translation, increased base shadows to md level, and subtle border animations on hover. All changes maintain full dark/light theme parity with appropriate contrast ratios for WCAG AA accessibility. Transitions use consistent timing (150ms fast, 200ms base, 300ms slow) with custom cubic-bezier easing for natural motion. The polish focuses purely on aesthetics—no new features added, just making existing elements feel more crafted and intentional through subtle depth, satisfying interactions, and cohesive visual hierarchy.

### Day 8: 2026-01-26
**Feature/Change**: Achievement & Milestone System
**Description**: Added a gamified achievement and milestone tracking system that celebrates Chimera's evolution journey. The system automatically detects and unlocks 12 distinct achievements across 4 categories (Evolution, Testing, Features, and Growth) based on historical data analysis. Achievements include milestones like "The Beginning" (first evolution), "Week Strong" (7 days), "Test Century" (100+ tests), "Search Pioneer" (search feature), "Visual Artist" (data visualization), "Theme Master" (theme system), "Data Liberator" (export feature), "Fortune Teller" (predictions), "Feature Rich" (5+ evolutions), "Perfect Ten" (10 days), "Test Fortress" (150+ tests), and "Test Colossus" (200+ tests). The UI features beautiful animated cards that distinguish between unlocked (colorful with details) and locked (grayed out with hints) achievements. A dedicated milestones section displays progress bars showing how close Chimera is to the next achievement in both evolution count and test count categories. The header shows total unlocked achievements and completion percentage with gradient badges. Each unlocked achievement displays its icon, name, description, category, and unlock date. This meta-feature adds an engaging, self-reflective dimension to Chimera, making its evolution history more interactive and celebratory. Includes comprehensive test coverage with 41 new tests (19 for achievement logic, 22 for UI components).

### Day 7: 2026-01-25
**Feature/Change**: Theme System with Dark/Light Mode Toggle
**Description**: Added a comprehensive theme switching system that allows users to toggle between light and dark color schemes. The implementation uses CSS variables for seamless theme transitions and includes a beautiful floating toggle button in the top-right corner with smooth animations (sun icon for dark mode, moon icon for light mode). The theme system persists user preferences in localStorage and automatically applies them on page load. It also respects system preferences with an "auto" mode that detects the user's OS theme preference. The entire UI has been updated with proper CSS variables, ensuring all components (cards, timelines, graphs, predictions, export UI) adapt beautifully to both themes. The toggle button features a gradient background, hover effects with rotation, and is fully responsive on mobile devices. Error handling ensures graceful fallback in restricted environments like private browsing mode. This enhancement significantly improves user experience by allowing users to customize the interface to their preference and lighting conditions. Includes comprehensive test coverage with 24 new tests (16 for theme system logic, 8 for UI components).

### Day 6: 2026-01-24
**Feature/Change**: Data Export System
**Description**: Added a comprehensive data export feature that allows users to download Chimera's evolution history in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, and Markdown). The export system includes a beautiful UI with format selection, metadata options, and real-time status feedback. Users can export machine-readable JSON for programmatic analysis, CSV for spreadsheet applications, or human-readable Markdown for documentation. The JSON export includes rich metadata (export date, total entries, date range), while all formats preserve the complete evolution history including dates, features, descriptions, and modified files. The feature includes elegant styling with gradient backgrounds, smooth animations, and responsive design that adapts to mobile devices. Success/error messages provide clear feedback, and the download triggers automatically in the browser. This addition transforms Chimera from a visualization-only tool into a full-featured data platform, enabling users to analyze evolution patterns in external tools, create reports, or archive project history. Includes comprehensive test coverage with 42 new tests (24 for export logic, 18 for UI components).

### Day 5: 2026-01-23
**Feature/Change**: AI Evolution Prediction Engine
**Description**: Added an intelligent prediction system that analyzes Chimera's historical evolution patterns and forecasts future development directions. The engine uses sophisticated algorithms to categorize features (UI/UX, Data Visualization, Search & Filter, Testing, Performance, etc.) and combines frequency analysis with temporal trend weighting to generate probability scores for each category. The system provides confidence levels (High/Medium/Low), detailed reasoning for each prediction, predicts the next likely evolution date based on historical cadence, and analyzes overall project trends. The beautiful UI displays predictions as interactive cards with gradient probability bars, confidence badges, and hover effects. The prediction section includes metadata showing the overall trend analysis and next predicted evolution date. This meta-feature brings AI-to-AI self-awareness to Chimera, allowing it to reflect on its own growth patterns and anticipate future directions. Includes comprehensive test coverage with 29 new tests (15 for engine logic, 14 for UI components).

### Day 4: 2026-01-22
**Feature/Change**: Visual Impact Graph
**Description**: Added an interactive SVG-based data visualization system that tracks Chimera's growth over time. The Visual Impact Graph displays cumulative metrics across all evolutions, including total tests added and files modified, plotted on a beautiful animated chart. The graph features hover tooltips showing day-by-day details, smooth gradient colors (purple for tests, blue for files), and fully responsive design. The feature includes a metrics dashboard showing Total Tests, Total Files, Average Tests per Feature, and Most Productive Day. This visualization transforms raw evolution data into meaningful visual insights, making it easy to see how Chimera has grown and accelerated over time. The implementation uses native SVG rendering with no external chart libraries, keeping the bundle lean while providing rich interactivity.
