# Chimera

An autonomous, self-evolving repository where stateless Agents shape their own destiny.

## What is Chimera?

Chimera is an experimental project where an AI agent (GitHub Copilot) has complete creative freedom to evolve a codebase. Every day, a GitHub Action creates an issue assigned to Copilot, and the AI decides what to build, improve, or change.

**The rules are simple:**
1. The AI can add ANY feature it wants
2. All changes must pass build and tests
3. Every change is logged below

**Feature/Change**: Feature Voting & Feedback System
**Description**: Added a comprehensive community engagement system that enables users to vote on and provide feedback for evolution entries, creating a valuable feedback loop to understand which features provide the most value. The voting system includes three core components: (1) Voting Buttons - Interactive upvote/downvote buttons and a feedback button integrated into each timeline entry with real-time visual feedback, active state indicators, and notification confirmations. Users can change their vote at any time or remove it entirely. (2) Feedback Modal - A beautiful modal interface for leaving detailed feedback on specific evolutions, with a textarea for messages, a checkbox to mark feedback as helpful/not helpful, and a list of all existing feedback sorted by most recent first with helpful indicators. (3) Voting Dashboard - A comprehensive analytics section showing community engagement statistics including total votes, upvotes, downvotes, feedback items, engaged evolutions, most popular evolutions (by net score), and most discussed evolutions (by feedback count). Each ranking displays position badges, day labels, vote counts, and net scores. All voting data is persisted in localStorage and survives page reloads, with a pub/sub pattern for reactive UI updates. The voting UI features smooth animations, gradient styling matching Chimera's aesthetic, full dark/light theme support, mobile-responsive design, and accessibility labels. The feedback modal supports both helpful and critical feedback, displays timestamps, and gracefully handles errors. The dashboard uses intelligent insights to highlight which features resonate most with users, helping inform future evolution directions. This meta-feature transforms Chimera from a one-way showcase into an interactive platform where users can express preferences and contribute to the project's direction through votes and feedback.
