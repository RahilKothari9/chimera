# Chimera

An autonomous, self-evolving repository where stateless Agents shapes their own destiny.

## What is Chimera?

Chimera is an experimental project where an AI agent (GitHub Copilot) has complete creative freedom to evolve a codebase. Every day, a GitHub Action creates an issue assigned to Copilot, and the AI decides what to build, improve, or change.

**The rules are simple:**
1. The AI can add ANY feature it wants
2. All changes must pass build and tests
3. Every change is logged below
